# Game of Life

Just a little project to get my hands dirty ^^

## How to run it

1. yarn start
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser et voila

## Tips

Check the `main.js` for some configuration options, like:

**DEBUG_MODE** to not auto-update but react on click to show the next update
**DRAW_NUMBERS** to see the surrounding numbers per organism (the name I gave each cell ^^)
**GRID_SIZE** the width/height of the grid
**ORGANISM_TYPE** organism being drawn as circle or rect
